# Introduction

**COCUMA Job Searcher (CJS)** is a Python script designed to enhance your job search experience on [cocuma.cz](http://cocuma.cz). If you find it challenging to filter job listings on Cocuma, CJS can help streamline the process.

## Purpose

As of now (Sep 2023), Cocuma performs full-text searches, which means it retrieves job postings containing specific keywords even if those keywords are not in the job titles. This can make searching for roles like "Project Manager" more complex due to the need for additional filtering.

## How CJS Works

CJS consists of two main scripts:

1. **cocumaScraper.py**: This script iterates through all pages of job postings on Cocuma and compiles them into a single HTML file.

2. **findJobs.py**: Using a list of preferred keywords provided in `keywords.py`, this script filters the HTML file generated by `cocumaScraper.py`. The result is a new HTML file that contains only job postings matching your selected keywords.

## Example

Here's a comparison of a "project" search result on Cocuma and the filtered result using CJS:

### Cocuma.cz:

### CJS Filtered Result:

When you open the filtered HTML file in your browser, you can navigate to job postings by simply clicking on the job titles, providing a user-friendly experience similar to using cocuma.cz.
